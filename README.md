My attempt to learn some JS through creating some small 2d browser games.

### Currently made games:
- Brick Break aka Breakout
- Pong
- Tetris (not 100% but close enough)
- Minesweeper (same as above)

### Currently working on:
- ?

### To do:
- Make Tetris loseable, add score counter, among others
- Implement powerups in Pong

## Disclaimer:
The code here is provided as is, and I hold no responsibility for anyone learning bad practices with it, as this is nothing but a sandbox for myself to learn and experiment in.
